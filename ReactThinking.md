# React Thinking
In ReactJS, to build a strong foundation and write cleaner code, one should be able to think and develop the right set of components. 
1. Break every big component into sub-components and list all of them. Follow **Top-down** appraoch.
2. Components Marking:  
- If components can be resuable across the project then mark them **global components**
- If components can be resuable across the module then mark them **module-name** components
3. For each listed component, Start thinking. and then listing all possible props considering the current stage of development. If you can also think of states for each component then it will be more helpful.
4. Start developing them using **Bottom-up** approach.


In ReactJs documentation, before talking about the fundamentals, they discuss the approach first. Some helpful resources for ReactJs thinking are as follows:
